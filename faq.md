## What makes Doug Coin credible?

We were endorsed by an unnamed world-famous economist who was widely known for giving lectures at Trump University.
The economist estimated that Doug Coin's market share would make Bitcoin obsolete by [January 19th, 2038](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem).
In addition, Doug Coin boasts a number of technical improvements over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and blockchains based on Bitcoin:

- Ability to recycle old blocks, keeping the size of the distributed blockchain to a reasonable size
- New and Improved blockchain scalability and performance, with transaction confirmation being almost instant.
- Minting of new coins is solely controlled by Doug (owner and founder), and thus will never suffer from unfavorable conditions like inflation or exchange rate fluctuation.
- After the IPO/ICO, the initial exchange rate will be determined by Doug flipping a coin several times and then pulling a number out of a hat. 

## Is this real?

Yes, just as Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is a real currency. Doug Coin is based on Blockchain Technology and Cryptography to secure transactions,
but the protocol has been modified and optimized to improve performance and security unlike any currently existing cryptocurrency.

## Is this a satire/parody?

Also yes. Figured I would be honest about this, since most of my jokes here are technical in nature.
The ultimate goal of this project is to discredit all proof-of-work blockchain technologies, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
